# Race Matcher

## Problem:
- Lots of people would like to get involved with the great sport of motorcycle racing,
but they're not sure what specific races their particular motorcycle is eligible for, and they 
ultimately end up not racing.

## Solution:
- Race matcher will solve this problem by telling you exactly what racing classes any motorcycle is eligible for based on a few simple parameters such as engine size, year built, etc. This will help aspiring racers overcome one of the more confusing hurdles into the world of motorycle racing.

## UX:
- This will be a single page app in which the user will enter some information about their motorcycle into provided fields 
(year, engine size, engine configuration) and the app will then present a list of race classes the user's motorcycle is
eligible for.

- The user enters the year, engine size, and engine configuration for their bike
- The app then returns a detailed list of all the racing classes they're eligible for
- The racing classes will be stored in a PostgreSQL database.

## Technologies
- Vue, PostgreSQL, Express, Heroku, KnexJS, Vuetify.
