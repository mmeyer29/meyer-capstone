# Race Matcher

## Problem:
- Lots of people would like to get involved with the great sport of motorcycle racing,
but they're not sure what specific races their particular motorcycle is eligible for, and they 
ultimately end up not racing.

## Solution:
- Race matcher will solve this problem by telling you what kinds of races your motorcycle is eligible for
based on a few simple parameters.

## UX:
- This will be a single page app in which the user will enter some information about their motorcycle into provided fields 
(year, engine size, engine, configuration) and the app will then present a list of race classes the user's motorcycle is
eligible for.
